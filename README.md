# Text Processing and Clustering README

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates a comprehensive approach to text processing and clustering, leveraging popular libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. It guides the user through the process of inputting sentences, which are then tokenized, stemmed, lemmatized, and finally clustered based on their TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores. The script also uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters and visualizes the results using word clouds and a plot.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Input:** Users can input any number of sentences for analysis.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Implements tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to normalize the text data.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converts the preprocessed text into numerical data, highlighting the importance of each word in the corpus.
- **Optimal Cluster Finding:** Utilizes the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters for K-Means clustering.
- **Visualization:** Generates and displays word clouds for each cluster and a plot for the Elbow Method.

## Importance

Text processing and clustering are fundamental techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, allowing for the organization and analysis of large datasets of text. This script showcases how to:

1. Preprocess text data to remove noise and standardize word forms.
2. Transform text into a format suitable for machine learning models.
3. Automatically determine an appropriate number of clusters for text data.
4. Visualize the most significant words in clusters to gain insights into the data.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed and proceed to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install nltk pandas scikit-learn matplotlib kneed wordcloud
